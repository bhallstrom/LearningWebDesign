<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>

  <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon</b> with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <u>November 30</u>.</p>
